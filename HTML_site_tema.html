        <p>What makes a brand last? Knowing the answer is what separates sustainable success from eventual obscurity. Almost every company devotes significant 
           resources to defining their brand. But few ask the equally important question: how to protect it?.
           Historically, brands have risen and fallen in prominence slowly. Look at almost any decade from the 1950s on, and the world’s most valuable consumer brands 
           from Oreo to AT&T - barely changed in ranking. Even as recently as the new millennium, this trend continued. Between 2000 and 2010 just two of Interbrand’s
           top 10 brands fell off the list. But only half of the brands on the list in 2010 remained as of 2019.</p>
